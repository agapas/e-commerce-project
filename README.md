# e-commerce-project

The app is still in **WIP** !!

A multi page E-Commerce website built with React, Redux (with Reselect package for memoization), GraphQL, ContextAPI and Firebase (for user authentication).

The app contains fully responsive pages:

- landing page,
- shop page,
- checkout page,
- the register & login page with an option of google sign in (user authentication with the Firebase, and user data stored in the Firestore).

Plans to add:

- contact page content,
- payment using the Stripe API.

### Additional info

The app is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
